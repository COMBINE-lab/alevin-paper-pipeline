Benchmark pipeline
------------------

CGATPipelines pipeline to run and benchmark various tools.

Plan is to have self contained downloading of data.
Will assume CellRanger, Kallisto and umi-tools are installed.

Will generate as much of references and indexes as possible.

Plan is to have a directory `benchmark_pipeline` and then a src dir within that.
Pipeline will run in the outer directory (i.e. witin the alevin-paper repo). Outputs
can be added to the github.
